## Final Project: A Database

In this project, your task is to create a **database**, containing data of
your choice, that can search, sort, and add/delete data. All the data in the
database consists of **records**, and each record consists of **fields** of
different types. For example, if your database is storing songs, then its
records might have fields for the song name (a string), the artist (a string),
and the year of publication (a whole number).

Your record must have **at least three fields**, and at least one field must
be a string, and at least one field must be a number. Please note this is the
minimal size of a record, and more fields are encouraged.

You should make your database about something you're interested in. For
example, your records could be songs, movies, books, games, celebrities,
sports teams, etc.
